Project Overview
This project serves as a dedicated server for the JustStone backdoor and STP (Stone Transfer Protocol). It is currently designed to operate as a standalone server, facilitating communication with the JustStone backdoor. Future plans include transforming it into a Command and Control (C&C) server. Subsequent to this transformation, a dedicated client is being developed to interact with the C&C server.

Components:
JustStone Backdoor: The server interacts with the JustStone backdoor, providing a platform for communication and control.

STP Protocol: The Stone Transfer Protocol (STP) is employed for efficient and secure data exchange between the server and the backdoor.

Future Development:
The project is in the process of transitioning into a C&C server, which will enable centralized control and management of multiple backdoors.

A dedicated client is currently under development to complement the transformed C&C server. This client will facilitate seamless interaction and control over the backdoors connected to the C&C server.
